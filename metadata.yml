GameTitle: SPACE NOMADS
GameBlurb: You play as a human space nomad, who has recently returned to a now sea-creature controlled earth. After plundering precious cargo, the dolphins are out for your head, and your only way out is a worn down space ship. Your pilot just needs 5 minutes to power up the warp drive. Defend yourself, your pilot, and your ship for dear life with guns and buildings as enemies swarm you from anywhere and everywhere. Live after 5 minutes and home is but a couple of lightyears away.
